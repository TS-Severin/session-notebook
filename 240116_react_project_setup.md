### project setup

**webpack**

=> module bundler

=> translates files we create in order to develop to browser readable files
=> passes these files to the client

**babel.js**

translates modern js into browser-compatible js

**vite js**

creates a basic boilerplate for react

vitejs.dev

=> in the documentation are the respective npm commands for using it
=> we can chose javascript or typescript
=> it scaffolds a project then
=> it runs you through the installation process

# if you are done creating the application

=> build-process => bring he app in a usable form

**command + t => open another tab in the terminal**
**control + c => stopping a running script**
=> can also stop an npm install process
**killall node => stops the server running**
=> close the tab also stops the script running

### boilerplate:

html with one div which is the root
=> from here we render the whole app into js
=> starting file index.js or main.js is also implemented

**there is a render element which renders <App /> the main component**

=> all the files in react projects could be named .js or .jsx
=> in vite is has to be .jsx

## create component

=> folder components
=> file: Button.jsx
=> type: rfc => have a component
<Button /> => function call => it returns whatever the function does
=> the function returns jsx in react and later js

=> the props returns an object => that's why we have to do either
=> all the buttons props are one object 
=> props.buttontext
OR
=> {buttontext}

## tool for google chrome and react
extension for chrome: react dev tools => shows what react renders
