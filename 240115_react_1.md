### react

-the folder structre gets more complex but comes with the implementation of react

in the package.json-folder is a line "scripts"
=> it starts the react-script
=> we can start it in the termina with
$ npm

=> the node modules are never included when they are pushed to git
=> that why we have .gitignore

=> starts react server

$ npm run start

in json package:
@babel

=> what is babel?

=> react creates a root-element in the index.js
=> it looks like js and html => but it isn't and the browser doesn't understand it
=> that's why we need babel as a translator

=> n the index.html there is a div with the root element
=> it queries the element in root
=> then it has a line rendering the content
=> `root.render`=> it is createElement, textContent, append(element)

=> if we use react we write JSX

-In the root.render function in the index.js we can simply write html which is then rendered by react
-we can also give classes but they are called not class="class" but className="className" (this is react)

## rendering things dinamically

const name = "pete"

<h1 id="greeting">Hello {name}</h1>

=> template literals are used without `` in JSX
=> everthing in {} becomes a js code and is rendered as such
=> we can't use if else but a ternary operator

<h1 id="greeting">Hello {name ? name : "stranger"}</h1>

## difference between .innerHTML and react

if we reload a react page => it keeps track of the variable states and only updates what changed
=> e.g. it would keep the input in an input field if it doesn't change while changing surroundings which are supposed to change

### working in components

=> usually we don't have anything in the render function in the index.js
=> we write a funciton which returns the htlm
=> give it an id
=> write the id like an html element in the root.render-element
`<Greeting />`
=> self-closing tag in html
=> these components are repeatable only using the html-tag
=> this is only working for function components

=> variables are in `{
}`
=> components are in `<>``

### file structure convention

- app.js

=> react sets up this file

=> we basically import the functions in index.js from app.js and put the function components in the roots.render-element

`<React.StrictMode>
<App />
</React.StrictMode>`

=> the react code is often wrapped into this
=> it helps us finding bugs
=> react does some testing
=> when the server runs it runs tests and gives hints
=> it does static testing
=> like lint

## convention for components

=> folder components
=> subfolder /greeting => index.js => here goes the greeting-function
=> subfolder /button => index.js => button-function

=> we call each file in the components index.js
=> the folder points to the index.js

=> many libraries like calender tools have been written in react
=> we can benefit from the open source apps written for react
=> it is for SPAs

### create react app

=> open link

https://create-react-app.dev/

=> run command in terminal
=> it creates a folder

npx create-react-app my-app

## fragments as wrapper element

=> so a function has to have a wrapper which wraps around all the others
=> for that usually we use fragments => empty tags => <> </>

## console.log in JSX

=> as usual in the function
